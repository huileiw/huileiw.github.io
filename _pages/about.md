I am a senior data scientist with Fundation, a fintech company specialized in small business lending. We are a company with a unique business model in a competitive market. My work area includes developing and monitoring credit risk models and using data science to drive growth and innovation in all business areas. 

My interests in data science include statistics (and Bayesian methods), machine learning, data visualization, and programming in python. In February 2017 I completed a data science fellowship at [the Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/). In December 2013 I received my Msc. in Statistics from National University of Singapore. 

In my spare time I love enjoying various types of ethnic food and am on track to finish Anthony Trollope's 47 novels.
