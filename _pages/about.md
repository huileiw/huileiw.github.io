I am a senior data scientist with Fundation, a fintech company specialized in small business lending. We are a company with a unique business model in a competitive market. My work area includes developing and monitoring credit risk models and using data science to drive growth and innovation in all business areas. 

I have recently completed a data science fellowship at [the Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/), where I completed various data science projects with topics ranging from web scraping to spark. In December 2013 I received my Msc. in Statistics from National University of Singapore. My interests include statistics (and Bayesian methods), machine learning, data visualization, and programming in python.  

In my spare time I love enjoying various types of ethnic food and am on track to finish Anthony Trollope's 47 novels.
